FILE 11 — CROSS-CUTTING RESPONSIBILITIES & ACHIEVEMENTS (GEP Program)
1. Overview

Across all modules delivered for Henry Schein’s Global E-Commerce Platform (GEP), the role extended far beyond feature ownership.
It required continuous orchestration, multi-team alignment, regulatory interpretation, and platform-wide decision making across US, Canada, and UK markets.

This file captures the cross-cutting responsibilities and achievements that applied to every module — License Management, Budget Management, Multi-Tier Approvals, Barcode Scanning, Statements & Payments, Controlled Substance Forms, Reporting, Profile & Preferences, and others.

These responsibilities demonstrate program-level leadership, platform governance, and deep functional + technical ownership.

2. Backlog Ownership & Prioritization
Core Responsibilities:

Managed multiple parallel backlogs across regulated and non-regulated modules

Converted ambiguous business asks into well-written epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria

Prioritized work based on:

regulatory deadlines

market launch timelines

customer impact

technical feasibility

cross-team dependencies

Partnered with product leadership to sequence global deployments (GenX → GenY → GenZ)

Impact:

Ensured smooth rollout across US/CA/UK markets

Prevented bottlenecks between teams (Deloitte, TCS, BST, UX, QA)

Reduced rework by ensuring requirements were complete upfront

3. Cross-Team Alignment & Stakeholder Management
Daily Coordination Included:

Clarifying business rules with SMEs, Compliance, Finance, Operations, and Sales

Translating regulatory/legal requirements into technical workflows

Running design workshops with UX

Reviewing tech approaches with architects & dev leads

Supporting integration discussions with JDE teams

Aligning with market leaders for UK, Canada, and US needs

Impact:

Reduced ambiguity during builds

Ensured alignment across 6–10 groups at any given time

Enabled faster approvals and smoother sprint execution

4. Requirements Documentation & Functional Design Leadership
Owned:

End-to-end functional designs for all modules

Detailed rules matrices, flowcharts, edge-case handling

State-based workflows (regulated markets)

Global configuration flags for multi-market behavior

Consistency across modules (e.g., how approvals, licensing, and payment rules interact)

Impact:

Engineers had crisp, complete, and testable requirements

Reduced confusion across US/UK/CA teams

Established a reusable design pattern across modules

Enabled smooth scaling to new markets (future GenZ expansion)

5. UAT Leadership & Quality Assurance Coordination
Key Contributions:

Collaborated with QA and SMEs to write test cases

Identified high-risk areas (e.g., payment failures, license expiry, multi-tier logic)

Performed hands-on UAT for every feature

Logged clear, reproducible defects with screenshots and workflows

Verified fixes and signed off on production readiness

Impact:

Caught critical compliance defects early

Improved reliability of go-live releases

Reduced post-production support volume

6. Change Request (CR) Management
Responsibilities:

Evaluated CR impact across modules

Translated emergency regulatory changes into fast-track requirements

Re-prioritized sprint backlogs without derailing core delivery

Ensured SMEs, Compliance, Dev, QA all aligned before implementation

Examples of CRs Handled:

New DEA/State rule updates

Budget module rule shifts (BOA → CC transitions)

New error categories in Statements & Payments

Profile security/verification changes

Impact:

Allowed GEP to stay compliant and up-to-date

Minimized disruption to existing release timelines

7. Multi-Market Governance
Governed behavior across:

GenX (UK) — lighter regulations, simplified workflows

GenY (US/CA) — heavy compliance, credit rules, payments

Future GenZ markets (EU) — new license types, EU regulatory rules

Responsibilities:

Ensured feature toggles allowed regional behavior differences

Validated that flows behaved correctly per locale

Worked with locale teams on translations (en-CA, fr-CA, en-UK)

Ensured currency, date formats, and product mapping were correct

Impact:

One global platform with consistent UX but region-correct rules

Enabled phased global rollout with fewer defects

8. End-to-End Workflow Reasoning (Cross-Module Interactions)

You maintained a system-wide understanding of how modules interacted:

License Management ↔ Controlled Substance Forms

Budget Management ↔ Multi-Tier Approvals

License Expiry ↔ Checkout blocks

Payment Method Rules ↔ Approval Logic

Reporting ↔ JDE data sources

Profile Defaults ↔ Checkout behaviors

This allowed you to:

prevent conflicting rules

catch business logic gaps

guide dev teams with the correct systemic view

design cross-module failure scenarios

Examples of Cross-Module Reasoning:

If user switches from BOA → Credit Card mid-order, MTA workflow must adapt

If DEA license expires mid-session, CSF, License Management, and Checkout must sync behaviors

If a scheduled report fails, how should Profile + Notification + Email modules respond

9. Regulatory Compliance Stewardship
You ensured compliance with:

DEA regulations

State pharmacy boards (e.g., Ohio TDDD, FL, TX, NY)

Internal legal requirements

Controlled product restrictions

Attestation workflows

JDE financial rules for payments

Responsibilities Included:

Reviewing Confluence regulatory documents

Creating compliance matrices

Updating workflows to match new laws

Ensuring correct validation logic

Adding warnings, disclaimers, attestations

Coordinating with legal & compliance SMEs

Impact:

Safe expansion into regulated digital product sales

Zero audit findings post-launch

Stronger internal governance

10. Vendor & Engineering Collaboration
Worked closely with:

Deloitte (front-end, middleware, checkout, payments)

TCS (GenX/GenY backend integrations)

BST / Data Engineering (payments, workflows, reporting)

Internal architects (workflows, patterns, rule engines)

Contributions:

Provided detailed clarifications

Facilitated multi-team alignment calls

Helped resolve technical blockers

Ensured engineering understood compliance logic correctly

Coordinated API contract drafts and impactful changes

11. Rollout Strategy & Cohort Planning

You helped define how features launch across:

UK first (GenX)

followed by US/Canada (GenY)

with groundwork for future EU markets (GenZ)

Core Contributions:

Helped define toggle-based activations

Supported smoke testing in early markets

Ensured features built for US/CA were configurable for UK

Coordinated cross-market UAT cycles

Supported training for customer support teams

12. Program-Wide Achievements
12.1 Delivered High-Risk / High-Value Modules

Delivered core pillars for GEP:

Controlled Substance Forms (compliance-critical)

License Management (DEA/state regulated)

Statements & Payments (financially sensitive)

Multi-Tier Approvals (enterprise adoption)

Budget Management (complex business rules)

Barcode Scanning (efficiency & global rollout)

Reporting (analytics adoption)

Profile & Preferences (security-sensitive)

12.2 Improved Platform Trust & Adoption

Reduced regulatory risk

Improved payment success rates

Increased license accuracy

Enabled enterprise-level approval workflows

Strengthened global readiness

12.3 Created Standardized Documentation Patterns

rules matrices

multi-step wizards

modular flow diagrams

business/technical ACs

cross-module dependency matrices

This became a reusable format for the program.

12.4 Established a Culture of Quality
