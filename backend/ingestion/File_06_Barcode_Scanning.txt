Barcode Scanning — Functional & Technical Blueprint
1. Problem Summary

Henry Schein offered barcode-based ordering, but adoption was low due to:

reliance on a desktop app + file upload process

inconsistent scanner recognition

limited global support

no mobile scanning

confusing user flow and missing real-time feedback

technical bugs around file parsing, browser compatibility, and scanner behavior

These issues slowed down replenishment workflows, especially for large clinics and DSOs ordering 50–200 line items at a time.

2. Business Objectives

Deliver a global, modern barcode scanning experience across US, CA, UK & future EU markets

Replace slow upload workflows with real-time scan-to-cart

Improve hardware compatibility (USB, Bluetooth, keyboard-emulation)

Lay foundation for mobile scanning (camera-based)

Reduce support tickets related to scanning

Increase online order volume by making reordering fast & frictionless

3. Functional Design
3.1 Streamlined Scan-to-Cart Workflow

The redesigned workflow:

User connects USB/Bluetooth scanner

Opens GEP "Scan Items" page

Page detects desktop connector app

Items appear instantly in a "Scanning Cart"

Each scan:

auto-adds item

increments quantity

plays a confirmation visual highlight

shows item name, SKU, and price

Backup option: uploading a CSV/TXT barcode list still supported, but now secondary.

Benefits:

No more manual entry

No delay

No pop-ups

No confusion on whether scans are captured

3.2 Desktop Connector App Integration

The desktop utility ("Scanner Connector") is required for USB scanners.

Key UI behaviors:

If the app is running → green indicator “Scanner connected”

If not detected → prompt user:

“Install connector”

“Open connector”

“Troubleshooting: scanner not detected”

The browser communicates with the local app via a lightweight local server (e.g., http://localhost:5010).

This solved the prior issue where scanning silently failed when app wasn’t open.

3.3 Mobile Scanning (Future-Ready Design)

You designed the architecture to allow a future “Scan with camera” experience:

mobile app opens camera

user scans barcode

app sends product code to cart API

consistent UI across web + mobile

In current version:

UI shows “Coming soon: Scan via mobile app”

backend already supports mobile-origin scanning events

This future-proofing allows rapid addition of camera-based scanning without architectural refactoring.

3.4 Barcode Printing & Catalog Integration

To encourage barcode ecosystem adoption:

Users can print barcode sheets from:

Cart

Shopping Lists

Account Dashboard

The PDF contains:

product image

SKU

name

barcode

Users can place printed barcodes on supply bins

This makes scanning practical even if product packaging lacks barcodes.

3.5 Error Handling & User Guidance

Clear guidance replaces ambiguity.

Examples:

Invalid barcode →
“Barcode not recognized – try again or search manually.”

Scanner disconnected →
“No scanner detected. Ensure the Scanner Connector app is open.”

Unsupported barcode format →
“This barcode is not valid for your region.”

These reduce support tickets and increase first-time success rates.

3.6 Multi-Market Behavior

Different countries have different barcoding standards.

You ensured:

UPC, EAN, and global variants supported

region-based product catalog resolution

scanning uses the correct regional SKU table

Example:

A Belgium user scanning a European EAN must map to the EU product

Not to the US SKU

This was crucial for GenZ (EU expansion).

4. Technical Implementation
4.1 Hardware Integration via Local Desktop App

Web → local app → scanned code → backend cart API
This overcame browser limitations (Chrome security restrictions).

Implementation included:

lightweight local HTTP listener

JSON streaming of scan events

periodic heartbeat check

automatic reconnects

Scanner types supported:

USB keyboard-emulation

USB HID

Bluetooth scanners

Rapid-scan mode:
Handles dozens of scans per minute without dropping events.

4.2 Backend APIs
Primary API: POST /addToCartByBarcode

Payload includes:

{
  "barcode": "0123456789012",
  "quantity": 1,
  "market": "US"
}


Backend processes:

Validate barcode

Map to SKU

Confirm availability

Add to cart

Return updated line item response

Batch mode:
Supports uploading lists or receiving many scans at once.

4.3 Catalog Mapping & Caching Layer

You introduced:

a cached barcode→SKU lookup (in-memory map)

reduces repeated DB hits during big scanning sessions

Caching drastically improves performance for 100+ consecutive scans.

4.4 File Upload Support

Legacy scanning workflows still supported via file upload:

CSV or TXT

one barcode per line

duplicates aggregated or itemized depending on user choice

Validation included:

ignore blank rows

ignore invalid characters

auto-aggregate duplicates

4.5 Market-Specific Product Resolution

Barcode rules vary:

US → UPC

EU → EAN

CA → manufacturer barcodes

Technical handling includes:

locale detection

route to correct product catalog

automatic EAN/UPC cross-ref mapping where needed

You worked with backend teams to ensure catalog APIs could serve region-specific SKU lookup.

4.6 Scanner Behavior & Troubleshooting Support

You drove resolution of:

scanners that append extra characters (“Enter” or Tab)

French/Belgian keyboards sending unexpected formatting

browsers blocking localhost requests

inconsistent vendor driver behavior

You coordinated between Deloitte devs, Henry Schein infra, and security teams to:

whitelist connector app communication

handle corporate network firewall issues

standardize scanning behavior

5. Stakeholders & Teams

Collaboration included:

Internal ops SMEs (knowing customer scanning workflows)

Deloitte front-end development team

Henry Schein backend integration team

European regional leads (BE/NL/DE)

UX design team (real-time feedback animation, scanning cart layout)

QA team testing:

6–7 scanner models

different browsers

corporate device restrictions

You also incorporated competitive analysis from:

3M

Zahn

Other dental distributors

Your work directly shaped the final scanning user journey.
