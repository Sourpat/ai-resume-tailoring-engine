Global E-Commerce Platform (GEP) – Program Overview

Henry Schein’s Global E-Commerce Platform (GEP) is a multinational digital platform supporting regulated medical/dental commerce across the US, Canada, UK/Ireland, and expanding EU markets.
The program consolidates all customer-facing ordering, compliance, payment, and account-management workflows under a unified experience with configurable market-specific rules known as GenX, GenY, GenZ rollouts.

The platform integrates deeply with JD Edwards (JDE) as the ERP for order validation, customer master data, license compliance, statements, payment posting, and approval workflows.

GEP is delivered by multiple implementation partners — notably Deloitte (US/Canada front-end & middleware), TCS (UK/IE legacy and backend extensions), and BST (integration, reporting, data).

1. Core Architecture Overview
Platform Layers

Front-End (GenX, GenY React/Angular variants)

Dynamic UI driven via configuration/feature flags

Market toggle for UK/US/CA behaviors

Conditional rendering based on payment rules, license rules, approval rules

Checkout micro-flows for budgets, multi-tier approvals, license checks

Middleware (APIs / microservices)

License validation APIs

Budget & Approval workflow engine

Payment processing layer (credit card ↔ SnapPay ↔ JDE)

Reporting scheduler and generation service

Controlled Substance Form (CSF) submission APIs

Profile & preferences service

ERP Integration (JD Edwards)

Order submit/hold/release

License verification and status mapping

Budget flags, payment terms, credit limits

Statement generation, payment posting

Customer master sync

Data Jobs & Sync Processes

Nightly license expiry sweeps

Multi-market catalog loads

Statement and invoice loads

Scheduled report triggers

Attestation and compliance flags sync

2. Market Rollout Structure (GenX → GenY → GenZ)
GenX (UK/IE)

First rollout of GEP

Simpler workflows

Less controlled substances compliance

Strict credit card-only = no approvals, no budgets

Older UI components and legacy code to be replaced gradually

GenY (US/Canada)

Full compliance-heavy implementation

DEA license enforcement

State license enforcement

TDDD (Ohio) and similar addendums

Credit card + budget hybrid rules

Multi-tier approval option

Advanced reporting + payment error mapping

GenZ (Europe – planned)

Requirements gathering in progress across multiple EU markets

Expected integrations: medical device licenses, pharmacy permits, regional payment providers

Requires fully configurable compliance engine

3. GEP Feature Modules (High-Level Summary)
MODULE A — LICENSE MANAGEMENT

Purpose: Ensure only valid, non-expired DEA/state licenses may buy regulated items.

Core Capabilities:

License capture, storage, validation

30/7-day expiry notification jobs

Checkout blocking when expired

JDE cross-check for latest license status

Attestation modal logic based on license type

Market-specific license rules (UK vs US/CA differences)

Integration with Controlled Substance Forms (CSF)

Key Technical Concepts:

Real-time + nightly sync

Flags determining when modals appear

Grace-period handling for timing mismatches

Location-level license mapping

MODULE B — BUDGET MANAGEMENT

Purpose: Enforce customer-defined spending controls, approvals, thresholds.

Key Rules:

BOA (Bill On Account) → budgets + approvals active

Credit Card → disable budgets, hide approval UI

Market differences (UK disables budgets for CC; US optionally supports hybrid CC+approval flows)

Technical Components:

Config-driven approval requirement flags

UI conditional rendering

Order submission logic that decides whether order remains on hold or goes to JDE

Error handling for mid-order payment method switches

MODULE C — MULTI-TIER APPROVALS

Purpose: Allow multi-level spending approval chain (1–3 tiers).

Core Capabilities:

Threshold-based approver routing

Primary + backup approver options

Approval Cart (central dashboard)

Notifications per status transition

Sequential or parallel approval patterns

Market toggles for CC bypass behavior

Technical Components:

Workflow engine

State machine transitions

Integration with order hold/release in JDE

Role-based visibility and permissions

MODULE D — BARCODE SCANNING

Purpose: Allow large clinics/DSOs to replenish stock by scanning barcodes.

Features:

Real-time scan-to-cart using desktop connector app

Batch upload of CSV/TXT

Barcode printing for bins

Error handling for unrecognized barcodes

Multi-market catalog mapping

Technical Processes:

Local listener app ↔ front-end communication

API lookup for barcode→SKU mapping

Market-aware catalog mapping

Offline fallback for bulk uploads

MODULE E — STATEMENTS & PAYMENTS

Purpose: Enable self-service financial management including payments, AutoPay, and viewing statements.

Functional Enhancements:

AutoPay enrollment filtering (show only unenrolled accounts)

Rule enforcement based on allowed payment methods

Enhanced Make a Payment flow (single/multi-statement, partial payments)

Mapping 30+ raw JDE error codes into user-friendly messages

Processing flows: retryable vs non-retryable errors

Technical Components:

JDE error mapping layer

Unified payment gateway messaging

Transaction rollback logic for multi-statement failures

Secure storage of payment methods

State management updates/reflecting enrollment changes

MODULE F — REPORTING

Purpose: Self-service scheduled and one-time reporting for purchase history, budgets, etc.

Capabilities:

Multi-step report creation

Modify existing report with pre-filled fields

Recurring scheduling (daily/weekly/monthly)

Email-based delivery with fallbacks

Failure notifications

Large data processing safeguards

Technical Components:

Report generation service + job scheduler

Data warehouse and ERP data retrieval

Recursive scheduling + failure handling

Localization (dates, currency)

MODULE G — CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE FORMS (CSF)

Purpose: Ensure DEA/state compliance when ordering controlled products.

Core Capabilities:

Dynamic CSF generation (state-specific addendums like Ohio TDDD)

Auto-prefill from License Management

Attestation and practitioner details

Manual vs auto-approval logic

Blocking checkout until CSF complete

Technical Components:

Secure form storage

JDE flags indicating controlled-access permissions

Validation rules (DEA format, state rules)

Bug fixing around missing state dropdowns (e.g., Ohio TDDD)

MODULE H — PROFILE & CHECKOUT PREFERENCES

Purpose: Give users secure and intuitive account management.

Capabilities:

Express Checkout defaults (payment, shipping)

Credential update security: password re-authentication + 3-strike lockout

Re-organized profile layout (profile photo, contact info)

Payment method restrictions surfaced from org settings

Multi-level default settings for organizations

Technical Components:

Profile service updates

Defaults applied during checkout flow

File validation for profile images

Security enhancements around credential updates

4. Cross-Functional Responsibilities Across All Modules

Across the entire GEP program, core recurring responsibilities include:

Writing, refining, and prioritizing user stories

Converting business rules (SMEs, legal, finance) into technical requirements

Leading system design sessions with dev teams (Deloitte, TCS, internal teams)

Creating edge-case analyses, flowcharts, matrix testing

Managing change requests (CRs) and compliance-driven updates

Leading UAT, writing test scenarios, validating integrations

Supporting feature toggles, cohort rollouts, and market-based launch planning

Ensuring regulatory alignment (DEA, state boards, controlled substances compliance)

Maintaining design system alignment and consistent UX

Coordinating data flows, integrations, and localization across markets

5. Global Value Delivered by GEP

Strengthened compliance (DEA/state licenses, CSF validations)

Reduced order failures and increased first-attempt success rates

Improved customer trust with transparent approvals and payment flows

Enabled global consistency while respecting regional rules

Reduced support tickets across payments, scanning, approvals, reporting

Increased online ordering volume from DSOs, multi-location customers

Established scalable foundation for future GenZ European rollouts
