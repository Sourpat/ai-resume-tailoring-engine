# Vector Store Layer
This folder contains scaffolding for the vector database used for RAG retrieval.
In Step 9, we will integrate Pinecone or Supabase Vector.
Current implementation:
- Local in-memory vector store
- Placeholder embeddings
- Seed ingestion pipeline

Notes:
- No real embeddings or similarity search yet.
- This is only for structure + local testing.
