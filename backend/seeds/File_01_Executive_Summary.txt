Executive Summary – Product Owner & Business Analyst (GEP Program)

As a Product Owner and Business Analyst on Henry Schein’s Global E-Commerce Platform (GEP), the role focused on delivering regulated, high-impact features across the US, Canada, and UK markets. Responsibilities included shaping ambiguous business needs into precise user stories, detailed functional designs, and acceptance criteria; coordinating with cross-functional teams; and ensuring compliance with stringent regulatory and operational requirements.

The scope of ownership ranged from core checkout controls to complex modules such as License Management, Budget Management, Multi-Tier Approvals, Controlled Substance Forms, Statements & Payments, Profile & Preferences, Reporting, and Barcode Scanning. Work spanned across all phases of delivery:

Requirements discovery & SME alignment

Functional and technical design

Cross-team collaboration (Deloitte, TCS, BST, UX, Compliance, QA, DevOps)

Backlog prioritization & change request (CR) management

UAT planning, execution, defect triage, and stakeholder reviews

Market-specific configuration (GenX UK, GenY US/CA, future GenZ expansion)

The role required translating regulatory constraints (e.g., DEA, TDDD, state-level restrictions) and enterprise purchasing policies (budgets, approvals, payment controls) into scalable, reusable, and market-configurable platform features.

Key Responsibilities Across All Modules
1. Requirements & Design Leadership

Converted ambiguous business goals into detailed workflows, user stories, and ACs.

Created functional designs for complex modules with edge-case coverage.

Led design walkthroughs with UX, Dev, QA, SMEs, Compliance, and other stakeholders.

2. Regulatory & Compliance Alignment

Ensured online workflows satisfied DEA regulations, state-level licensing rules, and pharmacy compliance protocols.

Documented and validated compliance steps (attestations, license validation, form rules).

3. Cross-Functional Program Coordination

Worked daily with Deloitte (front-end & integration), TCS (GenX/GenY engineering), BST, and internal architects.

Facilitated alignment across Product, Compliance, Sales Ops, Customer Support, UX, and Data teams.

4. End-to-End Delivery & Quality Assurance

Prioritized backlogs for multiple feature streams.

Led sprint grooming, story refinement, CR assessment, and release planning.

Coordinated UAT end-to-end with QA: test planning, scenario creation, triage, and approvals.

5. Market Rollout Planning

Tailored functionality per market:

GenX (UK/IE) – simplified controlled substance rules, lighter approval logic, different payment norms.

GenY (US/CA) – strict DEA workflows, robust budgets/approvals, complex Statements & Payments rules.

Prepared features for future GenZ expansion (EU/other regions).

6. Stakeholder Management

Acted as the primary liaison between business SMEs, regulatory/legal teams, engineering, and external development vendors.

Ensured clarity on business rules and provided guidance during architectural discussions.

Role Impact

The work delivered significant improvements to GEP’s compliance posture, checkout reliability, and customer experience—especially for regulated products, enterprise accounts, and high-value orders. Modules built under this role became foundational to the platform’s ability to expand globally while meeting local regulatory standards.

The combination of regulatory understanding, UX-aware design, and system-level technical reasoning established scalable patterns for future feature development within GEP.
