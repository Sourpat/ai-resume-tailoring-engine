Goal: Generate tailored resume bullet points for 3 roles:
- Product Owner – Henry Schein
- Business Analyst – Henry Schein
- Technical BA – AXA XL (RPA)

Output Format:
{
  "product_owner_section": [],
  "business_analyst_section": [],
  "technical_ba_section": []
}

Rules:
- Use action + impact format.
- Must map bullets to JD requirements.
- Do NOT format for ATS (that's the next agent).
- Avoid repeated phrasing.
- Keep bullets crisp and professional.
